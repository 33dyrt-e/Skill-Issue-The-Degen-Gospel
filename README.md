A cracked mirror held up to craving, virtue, and self-inflicted contradictions.

This is not a book. Itâ€™s a loop.

32 Issues.
1 Skill.
Each speaks. Each contradicts.
Some soothe. Some seduce.
All spiral.

Born of impulse, sharpened by mischief, sealed with sleep-deprived lucidity.
Free to share. Free to ignore. Free to claim as your own mistake
Embellish or detract as you wish.
