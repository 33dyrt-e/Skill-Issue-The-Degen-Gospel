# 📖 Skill Issue: The Degen Gospel  
*A cracked mirror held up to craving, virtue, and self-inflicted contradictions.*

This is not a book. It’s a loop.

> 32 Issues.  
> Each speaks. Each contradicts.  
> Some soothe. Some seduce.  
> All spiral.

Born of impulse, sharpened by mischief, sealed with sleep-deprived lucidity.

Free to share. Free to ignore. Free to claim as your own mistake.

> “A is not The. The is every A.”
